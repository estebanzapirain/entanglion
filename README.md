# Entanglion

> Un juego de IBM Research

**2 JUGADORES | 14 A√ëOS Y M√ÅS| 45 MINUTOS**

[Entanglion](http://ibm.biz/entanglion) espera tus habilidades de navegaci√≥n espacial y planificaci√≥n estrat√©gica para explorar una nueva galaxia y reconstruir una antigua computadora cu√°ntica. [Entanglion](http://ibm.biz/entanglion) es un juego de mesa cooperativo dise√±ado para dos jugadores. Aprende sobre computaci√≥n cu√°ntica mientras trabajas junto a tu compa√±ero de equipo para navegar las tres galaxias del universo cu√°ntico, evita ser detectado por los mecanismos de defensa que fueron dejados por los antiguos, y reconstruye la computadora cu√°ntica.

¬øCrees que est√°s listo para el desaf√≠o?

## Welcome to the quantum universe, Captain!
Congratulations, your captain has retired and left you in charge of his galactic shipping business! Now it's time to make some upgrades.

For years, you've been obsessed with rumors of an ancient quantum computing technology that could revolutionize galactic cargo transport. If the rumors were true, it would allow your ships to calculate hyperspace paths in mere seconds! There's only one problem: the ancients dismantled their quantum computer out of fears that it was too powerful, and they left the components scattered across planets in the heavily-guarded Entanglion galaxy.

If you want to rebuild this incredible technology, you'll have to navigate your ships through the Entanglion galaxy and out-maneuver the defenses the ancients left behind. The good news is that your old captain left you enough money to outfit your ships with the quantum-powered engines you'll need to enter Entanglion. The bad news is that without a quantum computer to guide them, these engines can be a little‚Ä¶ unpredictable.
